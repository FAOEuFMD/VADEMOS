## Objective
Develop a stochastic risk analysis model to predict FMD vaccine numbers and an interactive user interface.

## Summary of Development

### VADEMOS
*VADEMOS* is the name of the FMD vaccine number estimation tool made by EuFMD.
URL to VADEMOS: https://eufmd.shinyapps.io/vaccinationmodel
Ask Hyojung L. or Sylvia E. regarding Login info.

### Language
R for modeling and interface development // Python for data cleaning

### Modeling tool
mc2d package in R to run a two-dimensional Monte-Carlo simulation

### Interactive interface
The developed model was distributed with a web-based interactive interface built with R Shiny package. The tool is currently deployed with [Shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io), a cloud service for R products, with a free plan.

### Pending actions
1. To improve the visualization of the 'result' panel - Catch up with Roberto C. about the progress
2. To provide a regional summation of the predicted vaccine values - Consult with Bouda V.
3. To validate the model input as well as the results for the 11 West Asian countries - Consult with Bouda V.
4. To improve forecasting accuracy of parameters by integrating user feedbacks


## Data

### Parameters Data sources

| Parameter | Unit | Distribution | Source  | Notes |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---|:---|
| Population (LR, SR, P) | head | lognormal | [FAOSTAT](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QCL), Country's Statistical Institute | Future pops between 2021-2030 generated with a lognormal regression |
| Growth Rate (LR, SR, P) | % | normal | Calculated data | Python |
| PCP Stages | . | . | Collated from different sources, etc. Roadmap meetings, FAST reports | . |
| Livestock Density (LR, SR, P) | head/km^2 | lognormal | FAOSTAT + calculated data | Population divided by [agricultural area(km^2)](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/RL) |
| Sector Proportion | % | normal | [FAOSTAT](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QCL), Country's Statistical Institue, Focal points | No exact data available; deduced by the number of slaughtered animals per sector |
| Age Proportion | % | normal | Country's Statistical Institue, Focal points | No solid sources available; default value deduced from Turkey's data |
| Vaccinatnion area (ring) | km^2 | . | Focal points | Emergency vaccination ring area from the epicenter |
| Outbreak numbers | N | Poisson | Roadmap meetings, FAST reports, OIE WAHIS | No solid sources available; intensive data mining required |
| Prophylactic vaccine coverage | % | BetaPERT | Q2 responses of Delphi questionnaire | PCP-stage specific parameter |
| Outbreak coverage by vaccination | % | BetaPERT | Q3 responses of Delphi questionnaire | PCP-stage specific parameter |
| Outbreak reduction | % | BetaPERT | Q4 responses of Delphi questionnaire | PCP-stage specific parameter |

### Dictionary
* LR: Large Ruminants (Cattle)
* SR: Small Ruminants (Sheep+Goat)
* P: Pigs
* Focal points: Country representatives. We had asked to 3 Focal points (Georgia, Iran, Turkey) to provide us insights on their missing data a long time ago.
* Delphi questionnaire: Sarah W. and the team conducted Delphi survey to gather expert opinions on three unknown values (Prophylactic vaccine coverage, Outbreak coverage by vaccination, Outbreak reduction). In Round 1 of the Delphi, they didn't gather enough data to fit a BetaPERT distribution on it (e.g. lack of mode; the most probable value), therefore, the data was forced to have a BetaPERT using median as a replacement of the mode. In Round 2, only 2 responses were gathered and those were not parameterized to avoid bias.
* There are a lot of missing values due to the limited availability of country-specific data. For those parameters, default values were inserted as a place holder and a user should be able to modify those through a web-based interface.

### Countries
- **Oct.2021** 3 Asian countries (Georgia, Turkey, Iran) + 3 African countries (Ethoiopia, Uganda, Zambia)

- **Jan.2022** 11 Western Asian countries added (countries from the Western Asia region without historic PCP records were excluded)

- **Jun.2022** all other countries added

- Total 72 countries available in VADEMOS by Dec 2022:
    

## Validation of the data and outcome of the prediction
Hosted a a workshop designed for veterinary services from 6 countries (Georgia, Iran, Turkey, Ethiopia, Uganda, Zambia) to evaluate the quality of the input data collated as well as the ouput produced by the model. Gathered feedback is available in a post-workshop report.
